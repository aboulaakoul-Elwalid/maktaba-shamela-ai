There are several schools of thought in Islamic jurisprudence, each with its own methodologies and interpretations. The main differences between these schools lie in their approaches to interpreting Islamic texts, the sources they recognize, and their methodologies. Here are the four major schools of thought:\n\n1.
   **Hanafi School**:\n - **Founder**: Imam Abu Hanifa (d. 767 CE).\n - **Methodology**: Known for its emphasis on
   rationalism and analogy (qiyas). The Hanafi school places a strong emphasis on the use of reason and personal opinion (ra'y) in the absence of clear textual evidence.\n - **Sources**: Recognizes the Quran, Hadith, consensus (ijma), analogy (qiyas), and personal opinion (ra'y) as sources of law.\n - **Geographical Spread**: Predominant in Central Asia, South Asia, and parts of the Middle East.\n\n2. **Maliki School**:\n - **Founder**: Imam Malik ibn Anas
   (d. 795 CE).\n - **Methodology**: Emphasizes the importance of local customs and traditions (urf) and the practices of the people of Medina. The Maliki school is known for its flexibility and adaptability to local conditions.\n

- **Sources**: Recognizes the Quran, Hadith, consensus (ijma), analogy (qiyas), and local customs (urf) as sources of law.\n - **Geographical Spread**: Predominant in North Africa, West Africa, and parts of the Middle East.\n\n3.
  **Shafi'i School**:\n - **Founder**: Imam Muhammad ibn Idris al-Shafi'i (d. 820 CE).\n - **Methodology**: Known
  for its systematic approach and the development of the science of usul al-fiqh (principles of jurisprudence). The Shafi'i school emphasizes the importance of Hadith and the use of analogy (qiyas).\n - **Sources**: Recognizes the Quran, Hadith, consensus (ijma), and analogy (qiyas) as sources of law.\n - **Geographical Spread**: Predominant in Egypt, Southeast Asia, and parts of the Middle East.\n\n4. **Hanbali School**:\n - **Founder**: Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 855 CE).\n - **Methodology**: Known for its strict adherence to the Quran and Hadith, with a lesser reliance on analogy (qiyas) and personal opinion (ra'y). The Hanbali school emphasizes the importance of following the practices of the Prophet Muhammad and his companions.\n - **Sources**: Recognizes the Quran, Hadith, consensus (ijma), and analogy (qiyas) as sources of law, but with a stronger emphasis on Hadith.\n - **Geographical Spread**: Predominant in Saudi Arabia and parts of the Middle East.\n\nAdditionally, there are other schools of thought, such as
  the Zaidi, Ismaili, and Ibadi schools, which are prevalent among Shia Muslims and some Sunni communities, respectively. Each of these schools has its own unique characteristics and methodologies in interpreting Islamic law.\n\nIn summary, the differences between the schools of thought in Islamic jurisprudence lie in their approaches to interpreting Islamic texts, the sources they recognize, and their methodologies. These differences have contributed to the rich diversity of Islamic legal thought and practice.","message_id":"67e7493120aa7e53d983","message_type":"ai","timestamp":"2025-03-29T01:13:21.076634","conversation_id":"67e7491a0f24160eec3d","sources":[{"book_name":"ÏúÏÁ┘ê┘ä Ïº┘ä┘ü┘é┘ç ÏÑÏ¼ÏºÏ¿Ï® Ïº┘äÏ│ÏºÏª┘ä Ï┤Ï▒Ï¡ Ï¿Ï║┘èÏ® Ïº┘äÏó┘à┘ä","section_title":"Ïº┘äÏ¿ÏºÏ¿ Ïº┘äÏ½Ïº┘å┘è ┘ü┘è Ïº┘äÏúÏ»┘äÏ®","text_snippet":"No text available....","relevance":0.819926262,"document_id":"6315_0_2_0_758","url":"https://shamela.ws/book/6315"},{"book_name":"ÏúÏÁ┘ê┘ä Ïº┘ä┘ü┘é┘ç ÏÑÏ¼ÏºÏ¿Ï® Ïº┘äÏ│ÏºÏª┘ä Ï┤Ï▒Ï¡ Ï¿Ï║┘èÏ® Ïº┘äÏó┘à┘ä","section_title":"Ïº┘äÏ¿ÏºÏ¿ Ïº┘äÏ½Ïº┘äÏ½ ┘ü┘è Ïº┘ä┘à┘åÏÀ┘ê┘é ┘êÏº┘ä┘à┘ü┘ç┘ê┘à","text_snippet":"No text available....","relevance":0.809671342,"document_id":"6315_0_3_0_151","url":"https://shamela.ws/book/6315"},{"book_name":"ÏúÏÁ┘ê┘ä Ïº┘ä┘ü┘é┘ç ÏÑÏ¼ÏºÏ¿Ï® Ïº┘äÏ│ÏºÏª┘ä Ï┤Ï▒Ï¡ Ï¿Ï║┘èÏ® Ïº┘äÏó┘à┘ä","section_title":"Ïº┘äÏ¿ÏºÏ¿ Ïº┘äÏ½Ïº┘å┘è ┘ü┘è Ïº┘äÏúÏ»┘äÏ®","text_snippet":"No text available....","relevance":0.809653163,"document_id":"6315_0_2_0_676","url":"https://shamela.ws/book/6315"},{"book_name":"ÏúÏÁ┘ê┘ä Ïº┘ä┘ü┘é┘ç ÏÑÏ¼ÏºÏ¿Ï® Ïº┘äÏ│ÏºÏª┘ä Ï┤Ï▒Ï¡ Ï¿Ï║┘èÏ® Ïº┘äÏó┘à┘ä","section_title":"Ïº┘äÏ¿ÏºÏ¿ Ïº┘äÏ½Ïº┘å┘è ┘ü┘è Ïº┘äÏúÏ»┘äÏ®","text_snippet":"No text available....","relevance":0.808362544,"document_id":"6315_0_2_0_281","url":"https://shamela.ws/book/6315"},{"book_name":"ÏúÏÁ┘ê┘ä Ïº┘ä┘ü┘é┘ç ÏÑÏ¼ÏºÏ¿Ï® Ïº┘äÏ│ÏºÏª┘ä Ï┤Ï▒Ï¡ Ï¿Ï║┘èÏ® Ïº┘äÏó┘à┘ä","section_title":"Ïº┘äÏ¿ÏºÏ¿ Ïº┘äÏ½Ïº┘å┘è ┘ü┘è Ïº┘äÏúÏ»┘äÏ®","text_snippet":"No text available....","relevance":0.806216717,"document_id":"6315_0_2_0_1029","url":"https://shamela.ws/book/6315"}]}}

There are several
   schools of thought in Islamic jurisprudence, each with its own methodologies and interpretations. The main differences between these schools lie in their approaches to interpreting Islamic texts, the sources they recognize, and their methodologies. Here are the four major schools of thought:\n\n1. **Hanafi School**:\n - **Founder**: Imam Abu Hanifa (d. 767 CE).\n - **Methodology**: Known for its emphasis on rationalism and analogy (qiyas). The Hanafi school places a strong emphasis on the use of reason and personal opinion (ra'y) in the absence of clear textual evidence.\n - **Sources**: Recognizes the Quran, Hadith, consensus (ijma), analogy (qiyas), and personal opinion (ra'y) as sources of law.\n - **Geographical Spread**: Predominant in Central Asia, South Asia, and parts of the Middle East.\n\n2. **Maliki School**:\n - **Founder**: Imam Malik ibn Anas (d. 795 CE).\n - **Methodology**: Emphasizes the importance of local customs and traditions (urf) and the practices of the people of Medina. The Maliki school is known for its flexibility and adaptability to local conditions.\n - **Sources**: Recognizes the Quran, Hadith, consensus (ijma), analogy (qiyas), and local customs (urf) as sources of law.\n - **Geographical Spread**: Predominant in North Africa, West Africa, and parts of the Middle East.\n\n3. **Shafi'i School**:\n - **Founder**: Imam Muhammad ibn Idris al-Shafi'i (d. 820 CE).\n - **Methodology**: Known for its systematic approach and the development of the science of usul al-fiqh (principles of jurisprudence). The Shafi'i school emphasizes the importance of Hadith
   and the use of analogy (qiyas).\n - **Sources**: Recognizes the Quran, Hadith, consensus (ijma), and analogy (qiyas) as sources of law.\n - **Geographical Spread**: Predominant in Egypt, Southeast Asia, and parts of the Middle East.\n\n4. **Hanbali School**:\n - **Founder**: Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 855 CE).\n - **Methodology**: Known for its strict adherence to the Quran and Hadith, with a lesser reliance on analogy (qiyas) and personal opinion (ra'y). The Hanbali school emphasizes the importance of following the practices of the Prophet Muhammad and his companions.\n - **Sources**: Recognizes the Quran, Hadith, consensus (ijma), and analogy (qiyas) as sources of law, but with a stronger emphasis on Hadith.\n - **Geographical Spread**: Predominant in Saudi Arabia and parts of the Middle
   East.\n\nAdditionally, there are other schools of thought, such as the Zaidi, Ismaili, and Ibadi schools, which are
   prevalent among Shia Muslims and some Sunni communities, respectively. Each of these schools has its own unique characteristics and methodologies in interpreting Islamic law.\n\nIn summary, the differences between the schools of thought in Islamic jurisprudence lie in their approaches to interpreting Islamic texts, the sources they recognize, and their methodologies. These differences have contributed to the rich diversity of Islamic legal thought and practice.","message_id":"67e7493120aa7e53d983","message_type":"ai","timestamp":"2025-03-29T01:13:21.076634","conversation_id":"67e7491a0f24160eec3d"},{"user_id":"user_test4977","content":"Tell me about Imam al-Shafi'i's contributions to Islamic jurisprudence","message_id":"67e7493273bda6217c53","message_type":"user","timestamp":"2025-03-29T01:13:22.415289","conversation_id":"67e7491a0f24160eec3d"},{"user_id":"ai","content":"Imam al-Shafi'i, born in 767 CE in Gaza, Palestine, and died in 820 CE in Egypt, is one of the most influential scholars in Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh).
